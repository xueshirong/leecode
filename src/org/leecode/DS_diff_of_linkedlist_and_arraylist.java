	 * I enjoy the classic "what's the difference between a LinkedList and an ArrayList 
	 * (or between a linked list and an array/vector) and why would you choose one or the other?"
	 * 
	 * The kind of answer I hope for is one that includes discussion of:
	 * insertion performance
	 * iteration performance
	 * memory allocation/reallocation impact
	 * impact of removing elements from the beginning/middle/end
	 * how knowing (or not knowing) the maximum size of the list can affect the decision
