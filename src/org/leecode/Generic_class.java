	 * It would be nice if we could write a single sort method that could sort the elements in an 
	 * Integer array, a String array, or an array of any type that supports ordering.
	 * 
	 * Java Generic methods and generic classes enable programmers to specify, with a single method declaration, 
	 * a set of related methods, or with a single class declaration, a set of related types, respectively.
	 * 
	 * Generics also provide compile-time type safety that allows programmers to catch invalid types at 
	 * compile time.
	 * Using Java Generic concept, we might write a generic method for sorting an array of objects, 
	 * then invoke the generic method with Integer arrays, Double arrays, String arrays and so on, 
	 * to sort the array elements.
	 * 
	 * <T> specifically stands for generic type. According to Java Docs - A generic type is a generic class or interface that is 
	 * parameterized over types. 
	 * Let me start with an example: Consider a Box type that has two methods which is used to set and get objects.
